### Discussion Questions 

   1. Why do you think we use if-elif-else statements instead of just a series of if statements?
   
   2. Can you think of a situation where you might use multiple conditions to make a decision?  

   3. How might the structure of if-elif-else make your code easier to read and more efficient?
