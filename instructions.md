## Python: Making Decisions in Python
### `if-elif-else` Statements

### Getting Started

- Create a GitHub repo named: **text-adventure-starter**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - No need to share your repo with your teacher
    - Teacher will discuss your work with you during Teacher  Time

- Create a NEW folder on your workstation desktop
- Use VS Code to add your Python file to this new folder

### Your Code

#### Part 1

- Add a file to your repo named `weather.py`
- Write a short `if-elif-else` script that checks whether it's hot, warm or cold outside
- Display a corresponding message for each situation

--- 
#### Part 2

- Add a file to your repo named `text_adventure.py`
- Write a script that uses `if-elif-else` statements to create a text adventure
- Your script should:
  - welcome the user to your adventure
    
  - present the user with at least three (3) initial options (think *left*, *right* or *stay put*)
    
  - Your initial options will be the OUTER `if-elif-else` statement
    
  - Under your `if` and `elif` statements, include:
    
    - more info about what happens next (using a `print()` statement)
      
    - a prompt for the user (using the `input()` function)
      
    - an INNER `if-elif-else` statement
